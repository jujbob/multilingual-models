## Multilingual models

This repository contains the additional resources used in the paper "Multilingual Dependency Parsing for Low-Resource Languages: Case Studies of North Saami and Komi-Zyrian", written by KyungTae Lim, Niko Partanen and Thierry Poibeau in [LATTICE laboratory](http://www.lattice.cnrs.fr/), Paris. The additional materials include:

- Bilingual dictionaries extracted from Giellatekno infrastructure
    - [Finnish–Komi](https://github.com/jujbob/multilingual-models/blob/master/dictionaries/fin_kpv.tsv)
    - [Russian–Komi](https://github.com/jujbob/multilingual-models/blob/master/dictionaries/rus_kpv.tsv)
    - [Komi–English](https://github.com/jujbob/multilingual-models/blob/master/dictionaries/kpv_eng.tsv)
    - [Finnish–Northern Saami](https://github.com/jujbob/multilingual-models/blob/master/dictionaries/fin_sme.tsv)
    - [Northern Saami–Finnish](https://github.com/jujbob/multilingual-models/blob/master/dictionaries/sme_fin.tsv)
- Pretrained monolingual and multilingual word embeddings, latter aligned with [VecMap](https://github.com/artetxem/vecmap)
    - [Northern Saami–English](https://mycore.core-cloud.net/index.php/s/Yca4nj8e9xXWddW/download)

    - [Komi-Zyrian–Russian](https://mycore.core-cloud.net/index.php/s/aH6PFv4KohH7emV/download)
    - [Komi-Zyrian–Finnish](https://mycore.core-cloud.net/index.php/s/X6NWfynpC8UcrO2/download)

Komi-Zyrian UD-corpora have been later split into two sections, one for written and another for spoken languages, and they can be found in [Lattice](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Komi_Zyrian-Lattice) and [IKDP](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Komi_Zyrian-IKDP) repositories within UD infrastructure. In this study we have used the [version 0.1](https://github.com/langdoc/UD_Komi-Zyrian/releases/tag/v0.1), which is located in earlier repository which were not yet ready to be integrated into UD. We are fully aware that this version contains errors and inconsistencies, as there were in that point several open questions in applying UD annotation model to a new language.

Users interested about Komi treebanks are strongly encouraged to look into dev-branches of these treebanks, since they reflect the state that will be included in next UD release 2.3.
