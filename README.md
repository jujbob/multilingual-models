## Multilingual models

This repository contains the additional resources used in the paper "Multilingual Dependency Parsing for Low-Resource Languages: Case Studies of North Saami and Komi-Zyrian", written by KyungTae Lim, Niko Partanen and Thierry Poibeau in [LATTICE laboratory](http://www.lattice.cnrs.fr/), Paris. The additional materials include:

- Bilingual dictionaries extracted from Giellatekno infrastructure
    - [Komi--Finnish]()
    - [Komi--Russian]()
    - [Komi--English]()

    - [Norhern Saami]()
    - [Komi-Zyrian]()
    - [English]()
    - [Finnish]()
    - [Northern Saami--English]()

Komi-Zyrian UD-style training and test corpora are hosted in [](https://github.com/langdoc/UD_Komi-Zyrian) Git-repository, in order to keep that distinct from individual papers. In this study we have used the [version 0.1](https://github.com/langdoc/UD_Komi-Zyrian/releases/tag/v0.1). We are fully aware that this version contains some errors and inconsistencies, as there were several open questions in applying UD annotation model to a new language.
